# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an automated system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to identify fraudulent activities in real-time while minimizing false alarms, ensuring both security and efficiency in transaction processing.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand transaction patterns and fraud indicators.
- Develop and compare multiple machine learning models for fraud detection.
- Optimize model performance using techniques like SMOTE and hyperparameter tuning.
- Achieve high accuracy while balancing fraud detection and false alarms.
- Create a deployable solution for real-time fraud detection.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Feature scaling and normalization.
   - Handling class imbalance using SMOTE.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Development**:
   - Implemented and compared Random Forest, XGBoost, XGBoost with SMOTE, and Tuned XGBoost.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC, and Confusion Matrix.

## Results
- Best Model: XGBoost (Original)
- Precision: 88%, Recall: 84%, F1-Score: 86%, AUC-ROC: 99%.
- Successfully detected 82 out of 98 fraud cases with only 16 false alarms.

## Deployment Strategy
- Model serialization for real-time scoring.
- Integration with payment systems and monitoring framework.
- Regular retraining and performance monitoring.

## Future Work
- Explore deep learning approaches.
- Enhance feature engineering and develop ensemble methods.
- Implement real-time model updating.
